# YouTubeToMP3
## The Goal
I'm building a user interface that allows you to supply it a youtube link and it will downloadthe video in the highest audio quality possible (around 192 kpbs).

It then needs to extract the audio from the video (all downloads off youtube are in mp4 or webm, which are video formats)

The application will also give the user the ability to trim it, as well astrim off any silence at the end of a recording.

The last component of the project is that the program will amplify the audio if it has room (the recording must not clip due to high volume, otherwise it would sound bad).
